## ExpoSE

ExpoSE is a dynamic symbolic execution engine for JavaScript, developed at Royal Holloway, University of London by [Blake Loring](https://www.parsed.uk), Duncan Mitchell, and [Johannes Kinder](https://www.plai.ifi.lmu.de) (now at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/)).
ExpoSE supports symbolic execution of Node.js programs and JavaScript in the browser. ExpoSE is based on Jalangi2 and the Z3 SMT solver.

### Requirements

Requires `node` version v21.7.2 (other versions may work but are not tested), `npm`, `clang` (with `clang++`), `gnuplot` (for coverage graphs), `make`, `python` (Python 3).

`mitmproxy` (Depends libxml2-dev, libxslt-dev, libssl-dev) is required for electron analysis.

### Installation

Execute `./install` inside the ExpoSE directory for a clean installation.

### Complete instructions (including installing Node.js and NPM using fnm)

```
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
eval $(fnm env)
fnm install 21.7.2
fnm use 21.7.2
./install
./expoSE ./tests/numbers/infoflow
```

### ExpoSE CLI

Alternatively, you can invoke ExpoSE directly via the `expoSE` command line interface.

Example:

```sh
$ expoSE ./tests/numbers/infoflow
```

Valid Options:

- `replay` - Replay a test case with a specific input.
- `ahg` - Automatically generate a generic test harness for a specified NPM library.

### ExpoSE Browser Support

There is limited support for symbolic execution of webpages through a custom Electron based web browser. To execute ExpoSE on a website you use the same arguments as the CLI. Note: This also requires python3 and a modern version of mitmproxy to function correctly.

```sh
$ expoSE "https://google.com"
```

### Configuration

ExpoSE is configured via environment variables. All work both with the ExpoSE GUI and ExpoSE CLI. Typically these can be set from a terminal by writing a command such as

```sh
$ EXPOSE_LOG_LEVEL=1 expoSE target/hello.js
```

- `EXPOSE_MAX_TIME` - The time (in milliseconds) to limit the total execution
- `EXPOSE_TEST_TIMEOUT` - The time (in milliseconds) a test case can run for before being timed out
- `EXPOSE_PRINT_COVERAGE` - Print out the files checked by an analysis and show the lines which where explored by the analyzer
- `EXPOSE_PRINT_PATHS` - Print the output of each test case to stdout
- `EXPOSE_LOG_LEVEL` - Level from 0 (None) to 3 (High)
- `EXPOSE_MAX_CONCURRENT` - The maximum number of test cases that can run concurrently
- `RECOMPILE` - Force ExpoSE to rebuild before executing scripts

NOTE: To improve performance logging instructions are removed from the output at compile time and so will not be updated if `NO_COMPILE` is set.
